# University Network Simulation with Firewall Security

This project involved designing and implementing a computer network that simulates the structure of a university network. A key focus was on enhancing network security by implementing firewall rules to prevent misuse, specifically by blocking access to unwanted websites and social media platforms.

## üöÄ Project Description

The goal of this project was to create a realistic network environment mirroring that of a university and integrate security measures at the network perimeter. By configuring firewall rules, the project demonstrates how to control network traffic and restrict access to certain categories of websites, thereby improving network hygiene and preventing distractions or misuse within the university setting. This hands-on experience provided valuable insights into practical network design and security implementation.

## ‚ú® Features / Key Learnings

* **Network Design:** Developed a network topology representing a typical university structure (e.g., different departments, labs, administration).
* **Firewall Implementation:** Configured firewall rules to filter outgoing traffic.
* **Content Filtering:** Specifically implemented rules to block access to unwanted websites and social media sites.
* **Network Security:** Gained practical experience in applying security principles to a network design.
* **Network Management:** Enhanced skills related to controlling and managing network access policies.
